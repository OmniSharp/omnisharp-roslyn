[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/omnisharp/Builds/_apis/build/status/OmniSharp.omnisharp-roslyn?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/omnisharp/Builds/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

## Introduction

OmniSharp is a .NET development platform based on [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) workspaces. It provides project dependencies and C# language services to various IDEs and plugins.

OmniSharp is built with the [.NET Core SDK](https://dot.net/) on Windows and [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) on OSX/Linux. It targets the _net472_ target framework. For platforms other than Windows, OmniSharp ships with an _embedded Mono_ which is based on version _6.12.0_, includes MSBuild _16.8.0_ and is provisioned during the build script. If _Mono_ is globally installed on the system, OmniSharp will prefer it over the embedded version, however version _>=6.4.0_ is required (the lowest version with at least MSBuild _16.3.0_).

For Arch Linux users, you need package [mono-msbuild](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/mono-msbuild/) (>= 16.3).

In addition, if you need the HTTP interface and you want to run on Linux, you'll also need to make sure that you have [libuv](http://libuv.org) installed. See also https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1202#issuecomment-421543905 .

## What's new

See our [change log](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for all of the updates.

## Using OmniSharp

OmniSharp ships in two flavors:

-   Stdio server
-   HTTP server

### Downloading OmniSharp

When using OmniSharp with an editor extension (e.g. VIM, Emacs, VS Code), the extension will download or bundle OmniSharp automatically. If you wish to download OmniSharp manually though, follow the steps below.

#### Stable releases

Stable releases are published using [GitHub releases](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases). Each release contains a set of binaries for various operating systems and processing architectures.

#### Pre-releases

Pre-release versions are available in Azure Blob Storage, they can be viewed using the following URL `https://roslynomnisharp.blob.core.windows.net/releases?restype=container&comp=list&prefix={version}`, where the `{version}` placeholder can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). For example, all `1.37.x` versions (including all betas and prereleases such as `1.37.4-beta.5`) can be viewed using `https://roslynomnisharp.blob.core.windows.net/releases?restype=container&comp=list&prefix=1.37`. Please note that the listing is limited to 5000 entries.

Every merge to `master` is automatically published to this feed and individual release is then available using the following URL convention:
`https://roslynomnisharp.blob.core.windows.net/releases/{version}/{packagename}-{os/arch}.{ext}`

-   Version is auto incremented and is visible in the travis or appveyor build output
-   Package Name would be either `omnisharp` or `omnisharp.http`
-   `os/arch` will be one of the following:
    -   `win-x64`
    -   `win-x86`
    -   `win-arm64`
    -   `linux-x64`
    -   `linux-x86`
    -   `linux-musl-x64`
    -   `linux-arm64`
    -   `linux-musl-arm64`
    -   `osx`
    -   `mono` (Requires global mono installed)
-   Extensions are archive specific, windows will be `zip` and all others will be `tar.gz`.

### Building

**On Windows**:

```
> ./build.ps1
```

**On Linux / Unix**:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

You can find the output under `artifacts/publish/OmniSharp/<runtime id>/<target framework>/`.

The executable is either `OmniSharp.exe` or `OmniSharp`.

For more details, see [Build](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/blob/master/BUILD.md).

### VS Code

Add the following setting to your [User Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/customization/userandworkspace).

```JSON
{
  "omnisharp.path": "<Path to the omnisharp executable>"
}
```

The above option can also be set to:

-   "latest" - To consume the latest build from the master branch
-   A specific version number like `1.29.2-beta.60`

In order to be able to attach a debugger, add the following setting to your [User or Workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/customization/userandworkspace):

```JSON
{
  "omnisharp.waitForDebugger": true
}
```

This will print the OmniSharp process ID in the VS Code OmniSharp output panel and pause the start of the server until a debugger is attached to this process. This is equivalent to launching OmniSharp from a command line with the `--debug` flag.

### Configuration

OmniSharp provides a rich set of hierarchical configuration options, controlled via startup arguments, environment variables and `omnisharp.json` file. For more details please visit the [Configuration Options](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/wiki/Configuration-Options) section of the wiki.
