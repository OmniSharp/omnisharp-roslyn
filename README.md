Omnisharp based on [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) workspaces

This currently requires dnx version - 1.0.0-beta4 (see https://github.com/aspnet/Home). If you need the HTTP interface and you want to run on linux, you'll also need to make sure that you have libuv installed.

If you are using Mono, you'll need a minimum of verson 4.0.1

Run the server with ```./scripts/Omnisharp -s /path/to/project -p portnumber```
