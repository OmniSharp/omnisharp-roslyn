## [1.34.0] - 2019-07-15
* Added support for Roslyn code actions that normally need UI - they used to be explicitly sipped by OmniSharp, now it surfaces them with predefined defaults instead. ([#1220](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1220), PR: [#1406](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1406)) These are:
  * extract interface
  * generate constructor
  * generate overrides
  * generate *Equals* and *GetHashCode*
* Improved analyzers performance by introducing background analysis support ([#1507](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1507))
* According to [official Microsoft .NET Core support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core), .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 (`project.json`-based .NET Core flavors) have reached end of life and went out of support on 27 June 2019. OmniSharp features to support that, which have been obsolete and disabled by default since version 1.32.2 (2018-08-07), are now completely removed.
* Fixed a bug where some internal services didn't respect the disabling of a project system ([#1543](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1543))
* Improved the MSBuild selection logic. The standalone instance inside OmniSharp is now preferred over VS2017, with VS2019 given the highest priority. This ensures that .NET Core 3.0 works correctly. It is also possible manually provide an MSBuild path using OmniSharp configuration, which is then always selected. ([#1541](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1541), PR: [#1545](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1545))
    ```JSON
        {
            "MSBuild": {
                "MSBuildOverride": {
                    "MSBuildPath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin",
                    "Name": "vs2017 msbuild"
                }
            }
        }
    ```
* Added support for *AdditionalFiles* in csproj files ([#1510](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1510), PR: [#1547](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1547))
* Fixed a bug in *.editorconfig* where formatting settings were not correctly passed into external code fixes ([#1558](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1558), PR: [#1559](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1559))

## [1.33.0] - 2019-07-01
* Added support for `.editorconfig` files to control formatting settings, analyzers, coding styles and naming conventions. The feature is currently opt-into and needs to be enabled using OmniSharp configuration ([#31](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/31), PR: [#1526](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1526))
    ```JSON
        {
            "FormattingOptions": {
                "EnableEditorConfigSupport": true
            }
        }
    ```
* Analyzers improvements (PR: [#1440](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1440))
	* Dynamically loaded / modifiable rulesets instead without full restart on omnisharp after every change
	* Reanalyze updated projects
	* Built-int Roslyn diagnostics can be controlled by rulesets even when analyzers are not enabled
	* Faster analysis since project isn't updated every time
	* When project is restored it is re-analyzed with correct dependencies
* Added support for various renaming options - renaming any symbol can now propagate to comments or strings, and renaming a method symbol can also rename its overloads. They can be set via OmniSharp configuration, such as `omnisharp.json` file (they are disabled by default). (PR: [#1495](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1495))
    ```JSON
    {
        "RenameOptions": {
            "RenameInComments": true,
            "RenameOverloads": true,
            "RenameInStrings": true

## [1.32.6] - 2018-10-02
* Fixed a bug where virtual C# documents would not get promoted to be a part of a project. (PR: [#1306](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1306)).
* Added MinFilterLength to configure the number of characters a user must type in for FindSymbolRequest command to return any results (default is 0 to preserve existing behavior). Additionally added MaxItemsToReturn for configuring maximum number of items returned by the FindSymbolsRequestAPI.(PR: [#1284](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1284)).

## [1.32.3] - 2018-08-28
* Added support for files without a project. (PR: [#1252](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1252))
* Fixed a bug where `*.rsp`-based scripting references where not exposed in the Workspace information endpoint (PR: [#1272](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1272))

## [1.32.2] - 2018-08-07
* OmniSharp now targets **net461**, instead of **net46** (PR: [#1237](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1237))
* Added new `/codestructure` endpoint which serves a replacement for the `/currentfilemembersastree` endpoint. The new endpoint has a cleaner design, properly supports all C# types and members, and supports more information, such as accessibility, static vs. instance, etc. (PRs: [#1211](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1211) [#1217](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1217))
* Fixed a bug where language services for newly created CSX files were not provided if no CSX files existed at the moment OmniSharp was started ([#1199](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1199), PR: [#1210](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1210))
* The legacy project.json support is now disabled by default, allowing OmniSharp to start up a bit faster for common scenarios. If you wish to enable project.json support, add the following setting to your `omnisharp.json` file. (PR: [#1194](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1194))

    ```JSON
    {
        "dotnet": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
    ```
* Added support for code actions in `.cake` files. ([#1205](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1205), PR: [#1212](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1212))
* Added a new `/blockstructure` endpoint that returns the spans of the C# code blocks (usings, namespaces, methods, etc.) in a file. (PRs: [#1209](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1209) [#1231](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1231))
* Fixed bug where find usages returned usages from loaded `.cake` files even though `OnlyThisFile` was set to `true` in the request. ([#1204](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1204), PR: [#1213](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1213))
* Performance improvements for line mappings when working with `.cake` files. (PR: [#1226](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1226))
* Fixed a bug where a new debug session could not be started after a previous one failed due to build error. (PR: [#1239](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1239))
* Upgraded dependencies (PR: [#1237](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1237))
  * Upgraded to .NET Core SDK 2.1.505
  * Upgraded to Microsoft.AspNetCore.* version 2.1.1
  * Upgraded to Microsoft.Extensions.* version 2.1.1
  * Upgraded to MSBuild 15.7
  * Upgraded to Roslyn 2.8.2

## [1.31.1] - 2018-05-28
* Fixed bug where diagnostics from loaded `.cake` files was shown in the current file. (PR: [#1201](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1201))

## [1.31.0] - 2018-05-29
* Update to Roslyn 2.8.0 packages, adding support for C# 7.3. (PR: [#1182](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1182))
* MSBuild project system no longer stops when a project fails to load. (PR: [#1181](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1181))
* Fixed null-reference exception that could be thrown during MSBuild discovery. ([#1188](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1188), PR: [#1189](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1188))
* Fixed an issue where referenced projects outside of OmniSharp's target path/solution would not be evaluated properly if they were multi-targeted (e.g. contained `<TargetFrameworks>`), which could result in downstream failures. ([omnisharp-vscode#2295](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2295), PR: [#1195](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1195))
* Removed logic that set `MSBuildSDKsPath` environment variable before loading a project. This environment variable overrides normal MSBuild SDK resolution, which breaks resolution for custom MSBuild SDKs (for more information on MSBuild SDKs, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk#how-project-sdks-are-resolved)). ([#1190](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1190), PR: [#1192](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1192))
    * **Breaking Change**: Removing this logic means that OmniSharp will no longer load .NET Core projects that target a .NET Core SDK with a version <= 1.0.3 by default. If you need to restore this behavior, you can set the following option in an `omnisharp.json` configuration file:

        ```JSON
        {
            "MSBuild": {
                "UseLegacySdkResolver": true
            }
        }
        ```
        See [Configuration Options](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/wiki/Configuration-Options) for more details on `omnisharp.json`.
* Support `/rename` endpoint in `.cake` files.
* Support custom `.rsp` files in scripting. It is now possible to use `omnisharp.json` to define a path to an `.rsp` file, containing predefined namespaces and assembly references, and OmniSharp will respect those as part of its language services for CSX files. For example, given the following `.rsp` file:

    ```
    /r:bin/FakeLib.dll
    /r:bin/FSharp.Core.dll
    /r:bin/FSharpx.Extras.dll
    /u:Fake
    /u:FSharpx
    /u:System.Linq
    /u:System.IO
    ```
    and the following `omnisharp.json`:

    ```
    {
        "Script": {
            "RspFilePath": "path/to/my.rsp"
        }
    }
    ```
    OmniSharp will automatically include the predefined DLLs and namespaces in the language services for all the scripts in the given folder (in case of a local `omnisharp.json`) or on the machine (in case of a global `omnisharp.json`). Note that the reference to `mscorlib`/`System.Runtime` is always there anyway and doesn't need to be specified again in the `.rsp` file. ([#1024](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1024), PR: [#1112](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1112))
    * Note that the reference to `mscorlib`/`System.Runtime` is always there anyway and doesn't need to be specified again in the `.rsp` file
    * only imports and references are supported as part of the `.rsp` file (scripting doesn't support other compiler settings passed using the `.rsp` file). In the future, depending on whether the [feature is available in Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/23421), OmniSharp may also support defining a scripting globals type via `.rsp` file.
* `.cake` files are now parsed using the C# version `Latest` rather than `Default`, to match the runtime behavior of Cake. (PR: [#1201](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1201))
* Updated `DotNetTest` result to include messages from stdout and stderr. (PR: [#1203](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/1203))

## [1.30.1] - 2018-05-11

* When running a test via 'dotnet vstest' support, pass "--no-restore" when building with the .NET CLI to ensure that implicit restore does not run, making build a bit faster. ([#942](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/942))
* Add support for specifying the 'TargetFrameworkVersion' to the 'dotnet vstest' endpoints. ([#944](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/944))
* Do not throw an exception when attempting to "go to definition" on a namespace

## [1.23.2] - 2017-08-14

* Set CscToolExe to 'csc.exe' to address issues with older Mono installations where the MSBuild targets have set it to 'mcs.exe'.

## [1.23.1] - 2017-08-08

* Fixed two regressions with MSBuild projects:
  1. .NET Core projects were not properly processed if Mono was installed.
  2. When Mono is installed, don't set `MSBuildExtensionsPath` to `$mono_prefix/xbuild` unless both `$mono_prefix/msbuild` and `$mono_prefix/xbuild/15.0` also exist.
* Properly set new language version values to support C# 7.1.

## [1.23.0] - 2017-08-07

Note: This release now requires the latest release of Mono 5.2.0 or later to build and run. In addition, there are now six flavors built for every release:

* Windows builds that run on Desktop CLR.
    * omnisharp-win-x86.zip
    * omnisharp-win-x64.zip
* A *Nix build that be run on Mono 5.2.0 or greater. (Note that the `--assembly-loader=strict` flag must be specified when launch this build with Mono).
    * omnisharp-mono.tar.gz
* Standalone builds for OSX and Linux that include the Mono bits necessary to run OmniSharp.
    * omnisharp-osx.tar.gz
    * omnisharp-linux-x86.tar.gz
    * omnisharp-linux-x64.tar.gz

## [1.20.0] - 2017-06-02

* **Breaking Change**: When using environment variables to configure OmniSharp, they must be prefixed by 'OMNISHARP_', which helps ensure that OmniSharp will not unintentionally consume other environment variables (such as 'msbuild') if they happen to be set. See [Configuration Options](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/wiki/Configuration-Options) for more details on configuring OmniSharp. ([omnisharp-vscode#1512](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1512), PR: [#872](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/872))

## [1.10.0] - 2017-02-11

Note: This release begins a semantic versioning scheme discussed at https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/757.

- Scripting project system now delegates more work to the Roslyn `ScriptSourceResolver`, greatly simplifying the scripting workspace, and adding support for multiple `#load` directives and live updating of `#r` and `#load` directives. ([#227](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/227), [#689](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/689), PR: [#760](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/760))
- Ensure that the DotNetProjectSystem is initialized with the Roslyn `DefaultAssemblyIdentityComparer.Default` to allow assembly references to unify properly. ([omnisharp-vscode#1221](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1221), PR: [#763](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/763))
- Also use Roslyn's `DefaultAssemblyIdentityComparer.Default` for scripting as well. (PR: [#764](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/764))
