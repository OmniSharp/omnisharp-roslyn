* Add support for specifying the 'TargetFrameworkVersion' to the 'dotnet vstest' endpoints. ([#944](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/944))
* Do not throw an exception when attempting to "go to definition" on a namespace

## [1.23.2] - 2017-08-14

## [1.23.1] - 2017-08-08

* Fixed two regressions with MSBuild projects:
  1. .NET Core projects were not properly processed if Mono was installed.
  2. When Mono is installed, don't set `MSBuildExtensionsPath` to `$mono_prefix/xbuild` unless both `$mono_prefix/msbuild` and `$mono_prefix/xbuild/15.0` also exist.
* Properly set new language version values to support C# 7.1.

## [1.23.0] - 2017-08-07

## [1.20.0] - 2017-06-02

* **Breaking Change**: When using environment variables to configure OmniSharp, they must be prefixed by 'OMNISHARP_', which helps ensure that OmniSharp will not unintentionally consume other environment variables (such as 'msbuild') if they happen to be set. See [Configuration Options](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/wiki/Configuration-Options) for more details on configuring OmniSharp. ([omnisharp-vscode#1512](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1512), PR: [#872](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/872))

## [1.10.0] - 2017-02-11

Note: This release begins a semantic versioning scheme discussed at https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/757.

- Scripting project system now delegates more work to the Roslyn `ScriptSourceResolver`, greatly simplifying the scripting workspace, and adding support for multiple `#load` directives and live updating of `#r` and `#load` directives.
