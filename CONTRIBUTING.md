# Contributing

OmniSharp is always thrilled to welcome any contributions!

## Where to find help

Before contributing any feature, make sure to discuss it upfront with the team - this can be done on Github in an [issue](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues) or on [Slack](https://goo.gl/Ovnqr1).  

## Workflow

* We use the `master` branch for active development. All pull requests should be made to this branch.
* Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
